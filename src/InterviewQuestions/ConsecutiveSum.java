    1.Java coding challenge.

Given the following method signature,

int MaxWindowTotal(int[] values, int windowSize);

MaxWindowTotal will take an array of integers and a window size, and return the maximum total of any

consecutive sequence of integers of length windowSize.

For example, given (array =Â  [5, 12, 25, 7, 9], window size = 3), the method will return 44 (the sum of 12,

25, and 7 is the greatest total of any 3 consecutive integers in the array).

You can not use any ready libraries or methods. I completed it with nested

loops he asked me to try to do it without having nested loops.
